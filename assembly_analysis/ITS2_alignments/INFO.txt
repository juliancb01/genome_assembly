ITS2 = conserved sequence used for barcoding in Symbiodiniaceae
Since suspect microalgal contamination in WT, ran BLAST against contigs in each HIFI 
    only assembly with every known Symbiodiniaceae ITS2 sequence as the query. 

The rmd file has the analysis of these BLAST results, mapping the best alignments 
    (by length i.e., alignment starts within 10bp of the beginning and ends within 10bp of 
    the end so the match extends for most of the ITS2 sequence: other matches discarded as 
    unlikely matches - expect low e-values as the sequences are very similar: many matches if 
    just filtering by e-value < 1e-5)
