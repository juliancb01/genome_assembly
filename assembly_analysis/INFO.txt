Typical genome assessment = QUAST & BUSCO
QUAST = --reference flag for comparison against Cladocopium proliferum reference
    thus gives another measure of ~completeness (on top of BUSCO)
BUSCO = comparison against Alveolate database - the 'closest' taxonomic group
    to Symbiodiniaceae available to download (superphylum/major-order level)

Other: coverage analysis rmd file = plots for coverage & length of contigs 
    ^useful to identify outliers (really short contigs with high coverage?)
    & assess general 'spread' of coverage across contigs (e.g., how much coverage
    do the longest contigs have?)
